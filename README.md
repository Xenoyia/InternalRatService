Automatically collects all taxes each new day, and shows a notification of how much is collected. No more waiting for the slow tax office or manually groping every rat for their owed taxes!

This mod requires Bepinex5 to be installed, please download the latest one for your OS here: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases

﻿Then in Steam\steamapps\common\Ratopia, extract it and make sure the BepInEx folder is alongside MonoBleedingEdge and Ratopia_Data.

To install my mod, simply place the .dll in the ﻿Steam\steamapps\common\Ratopia\BepInEx\plugins folder. It should just work if you did all this correctly.
